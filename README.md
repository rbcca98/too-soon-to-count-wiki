# too-soon-to-count-wiki
This repository houses the python scripts used to collect and process data discussed in our group's publication, "Too soon to count," accepted to the journal Big Data & Society as of January 2023.

The scripts are found in two folders, each involving two segments of our data analysis pipeline. The first folder "wikidata_info" contains scripts used to collect information on all academics whose Wikipedia articles have been flagged for deletion from 2017-2020. The second folder "g_search" uses this information, along with more data collected from our webscraping process, to generate a Google Index, a value that is compared to a corresponding Primer Index as referenced in our publication.
